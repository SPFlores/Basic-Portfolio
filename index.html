            <p>Samantha Flores, up and coming hopeful keyboard maestro, graduated from LMU with a BS in Biology in May
                of 2014. Since then, she has been a lab quality tester for things as diverse as flavorings for your
                favorite foods, nutritional supplements to help you live a healthier life, and medical devices that are
                used daily to save lives. She's coming back for another round of schooling because of her lifelong
                desire to learn and her interest in the future. While she briefly considered minoring in Computer
                Science in college, most of this information is new to her.

            <p>Samantha prefers to be called Sam or Sammi--Samantha makes her feel like she's in trouble for something.
                She is also used to being called a number of different names as she has 3 siblings
                Preferring to be called Sam or Sammi (Samantha makes her feel like she's in trouble),
                Lover of books, games, music, and superheroes. They’re definitely all created
                equal. Except for Batman. Never, ever badmouth the Bat. While he protects Gotham’s nights, Sammi toils
                to keep the days smooth and wonderful. If you need an understanding ear, a keen mind, or a witty turn of
                phrase, look no further. She can deliver all of that and more! And once her fingers start flying over
                that keyboard by the end of this program, nothing will be beyond her grasp. Sit back, relax, and let’s
                learn together.</p>
