            <p>Samantha Flores recently finished a web development coding bootcamp at UCI, an experience that packed all aspects of full stack development into about 6 months' worth of classes, all completed in addition to a ful-time job. With an emphasis on both solo and group projects, the class focused on mobile-first development and React applications.

            <p>Samantha prefers to be called Sam or Sammi--Samantha makes her feel like she's in trouble for something.
                Sam is a lover of coffee, books, superheroes, and science and technology, in aproximately that order. She'll take her coffee almost any way you serve it, as long as there's a lot of it. You don't want to see her without her daily caffeine fix. In terms of books, Sammi will read almost anything--she read 32 last year alone from a wide variety of genres and authors and is always looking for recommendations. If given the chance, she wouold run away to be the next Robin. Science will always be here favorite subject, but she's found a new passion for web development.
